title: Svelte + Sapper - Why I Use It
---

> Sapper is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.
> Unlike single-page apps, Sapper doesn't compromise on SEO, progressive enhancement or the initial load experience â€” but unlike traditional server-rendered apps, navigation is instantaneous for that app-like feel.
